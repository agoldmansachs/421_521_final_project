Shaken-not-stirred cold coffee brewer     
	
	The purpose of this product is to automate the process of cold brewing coffee the way the user prefers it. The current problem with homemade cold brew is that the system is stationary: the grounds stay at the bottom of the container, concentrating the bottom layer of water. This creates a low quality, inhomogeneous cold brew. The flavor and strength of cold brew coffee depends on the temperature of the water at the beginning of the brew, the length of time brewed, and the fineness of the grounds. Our objective is to create a cold brew coffee inverter that uses user preferences to develop the perfect cup of cold brew. Through a touchscreen display, the user will input their preferences of acidity level, strength of flavor, fineness of grounds used, and volume brewed. These inputs will affect the frequency of agitation and length of brew, which is controlled by a stepper motor connected to a RAMBo board. The only user input will be to add water, new grounds, and preferences to the device. The rest is taken care of and the user can wake up to a perfect cup of cold brew coffee.
